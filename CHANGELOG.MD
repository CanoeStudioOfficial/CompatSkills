## 1.7.0

- Added "none" as a requirement type that basically removes all locks from an item. This allows for locking an entire mod and then unlocking specific items. The config previously stated that this would work and now it works again.
- Some minor performance improvements and code cleanup.
- Fixed the scroll buttons in the skills gui being slightly off center.
- Fixed the permission levels of all the commands so that they can be run from command blocks. (Or from functions like Triumph uses)
- Created a way to cache requirements so that they only have to be recalculated when something has changed. This provides a substantial performance increase.
- Better tooltip caching for hovering and rewrote how tooltips are handled internally so that they are more efficient for calculating and for inverting the color for NOT requirements.
- Created RequirementExceptions so that more detailed error messages can be given when a requirement string is invalid. This also makes logic requirements provide a simple "stacktrace" to which part of the requirement is formatted wrong.
- Made it so that if Unlockables/Traits have a cost of 0 then they will automatically unlock when all the requirements are met. This allows the GameStageUnlockables in CompatSkills to automatically unlock a gamestage when the requirements are met. This all is done utilizing the new requirement caching so that it only has to recheck the traits when something changed. (What that means is it will not negatively impact performance!)


## 1.6.0

- Added ru_RU localization
  - Thanks goes out to: Pirog17000
- Implemented an Unobtainable Requirement
  - Yup, this is a thing now, just use "unobtainable" as the requirement string
- Added Logical Requirements. Format followed by an example can be found below.
  - NOT
    - not|requirement
    - not|dim|0
  - AND
    - and|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - and|[reskillable:building|7]~[reskillable:building|5]
  - NAND
    - nand|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - nand|[dim|1]~[dim|-1]
  - OR
    - or|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - or|[reskillable:mining|5]~[reskillable:building|5]
  - NOR
    - nor|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - nor|[reskillable:farming|5]~[reskillable:gathering|5]
  - XOR
    - xor|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - xor|[dim|0]~[reskillable:building|5]
  - XNOR
    - xnor|[requirement]~[requirement]
    - xnor|[reskillable:agility|5]~[reskillable:farming|5]
- Made some internal API changes to allow for some of the new features in CompatSkills



## 1.5.1

- Fixed a crash on servers


## 1.5.0

- Implemented better support for Negative-Stagger Values
- Implemented Commands for the following things:
  - Incrementing a Skill Level by 1
    - /reskillable incrementskill <player> <skill>
  - Setting a Specific Skill to a Specific Level
    - /reskillable setskilllevel <player> <skill> <level>
  - Reset a specific Skill to 1
    - /reskillable resetskill <player> <skill>
  - Resetting all Skills to 1
    - /reskillable resetall <player>
  - Adding/Removing a specific Trait
    - /reskillable toggletrait <player> <trait>
- Added a new Event called 'LockUnlockableEvent'
- Added an Config option to disable the level-up button and using exp for skills.
- Added a safety check for Null PlayerData which defaults the tooltip info to 'un-earned'
- Added a config option to show requirements without having to press-shift.
- Implemented improvements to the Tooltip Code
- Improved the Level-Up event to provide more info to check against.
  - This modifies LevelUpEvent to support what the previous level is.
  - Because the commands bypass whatever locks may be on the skills or traits directly, this was chosen over manually running levelup multiple times as the new level may be lower than the old level.
  - This does not fully address #75 as it manually fires the events so that it can let the user know if the command was cancelled.
 


## 1.4.0

- Implemented the "Hill-Walker" trait
  - This Trait adds Step-Assist!
  - Fixes [#88](https://github.com/Coders-After-Dark/Reskillable/issues/88)

  - Fixed [#72](https://github.com/Coders-After-Dark/Reskillable/issues/72)

## 1.3.0

- Large Improvements to the NBT-Handling Internally
- Large Improvements to the Lock System
  - Made it overall more Generic



## 1.2.2

- Added mcmod.info file


## 1.2.1

- Fix being able to place blocks that are locked


## 1.2.0

- Added Mod-Based Gating
  - This only works in Configs
  - This is implemented as:
    - Example:
      - "minecraft=reskillable:defense|5,reskillable:magic|5"
- Improved NBT Matching A LOT more powerful!
  - Added Partial NBT Matches
  - Added Lock-Merging
  - Added improved NBT Matching.
- So what does all of this mean?
  - Well for example:
    - NBT Locks Override Base-locks!
      - This means that if you have a base lock of 16
      - And a NBT lock with the same value of 8
      - Once you add the NBT Lock it'll lower the value to 8!
    - By adding a script like this:
      - https://gist.github.com/Lanse505/b19fe16f3c177ff7e0162e5761e4d1ca
        - Locks are for:
          - Efficienty 5
          - Silk Touch
          - Unbreaking 3
        - You'd get a result like this with all enchantments applied: 
          - https://i.imgur.com/gCfETAh.png
- Fixed NPE crashes with Null Skills and Traits!



## 1.1.0

- Added Config Option for X-Y Position for Traits in the GUI
- Added Better NBT Handling (Credit to pupnewfster for the PR) 
    - [Requires: CompatSkills's CrT Support]
- Added Metadata Handling for config (Credit to pupnewfster for the PR) 
    - Syntax is now: 
        - Modid:item:meta 
            - `minecraft:skull:1`
        - Also now supports wildcard metadata 
            - minecraft:diamond_sword:* 
        - If no Metadata is added, it defaults to 0
- Changed "Green Thumbs" now to apply a bone meal tick to a Growable block instead of adding a random tick to it. 
    - Might be rebalanced as time goes on!




## 1.0.0

General:
- Removed reliance on AutoRegLib

Non-Modders:
Additions:
- Added support for individual Skill level max values.
- Added a scrolling feature to the Skill Info GUI.
- Added Support for Level-Based Staggering Amounts! (See Below)
- Rewrote the config backend to support more powerful options for Skills and Traits.

- Added Trait Requirements!
    - You can now gate items/blocks/traits behind other Traits!
        - Syntax:
            - "trait|reskillable:roadwalk"
            - "trait|reskillable:sidestep"
            - "trait|reskillable:neutralissse"

- The new config system supports:
    - Supports values on a per-skill basis!
    - Setting/Changing requirements on Traits
    - Enable/Disable Skills & Traits
        - Examples:
            - Skills: https://i.imgur.com/N6Cs26N.png
            - Traits: https://i.imgur.com/4My9soP.png

- Added a new Cost Staggering system for Skills
	- Base + (currentLevel + stagger)
	- Example
		- Base = 1
		- Level = 1
		- Stagger [{
			1|1
			10|2
		}]

		- This means the equation for level 1-9 would be:
			- 1 + (currentLevel + 1)
		- While anything past 9 would be:
			- 1 + (currentLevel + 2)

Fixes:
- Fixed [Vaskii#23](https://github.com/Vazkii/Skillable/issues/23) - You should now be able to properly lock TE Machine Upgrades
- Fixed [Vaskii#18](https://github.com/Vazkii/Skillable/issues/18) - Implemented a fix for the Perfect Recovery Trait
- Fixed [Vaskii#20](https://github.com/Vazkii/Skillable/issues/20) and [Reskillable#5](https://github.com/Vazkii/Skillable/issues/5) making it so Reskillable now works on Servers.
- Implemented a potential fix for [Reskillable#14](https://github.com/Coders-After-Dark/Reskillable/issues/14) - Tools that can break multiple blocks should now not be able to cheese Reskillable.
- Implemented an improved behavior to the level-up button to make it more obvious where to click to invest experience for points.
    - Fixes [Reskillable#11](https://github.com/Coders-After-Dark/Reskillable/issues/11)


Modders:
- Implemented a large-scale API rewrite!
    - You can now as a modder add new skills, traits, and requirements to Reskillable through an addon!
- Skill icons are now based on the name of the skill.
    - See: https://github.com/Coders-After-Dark/Reskillable/blob/feature/api/src/main/java/codersafterdark/reskillable/api/skill/Skill.java#L26
    - This means for example if your mod id is XYZ and you make a skill called "ninja", you'll need to add the skill icon texture to:
        - "xyz:textures/skills/ninja"
- Implemented it so the Skill Constructor now takes a resource location for the background texture for the Skill Info GUI instead of a Block instance.
- Skills and Unlockables now use Forge Registries which can be found under: ReskillableRegistries.SKILLS.register or ReskillableRegistries.UNLOCKABLES.register
- Requirements are added in their own non-forge registry which can be found under: ReskillableAPI.getInstance().getRequirementRegistry().addRequirementHandler
